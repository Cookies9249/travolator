# Travolator

Travolator is a website that uses AI to generate an itinerary given an origin and destination, using Geoapify API, OpenAI API, and Google Maps functionality to provide real-world information.

Built With: HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, Python

Libraries: Streamlit

APIs: Geoapify, OpenAI

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for Travolator came from the desire to simplify and enhance the vacation planning process. We noticed that many people often feel overwhelmed with the abundance of information available online and struggle to find reliable recommendations tailored to their preferences. We wanted to create a tool that would streamline the planning experience and provide personalized suggestions to make every trip extraordinary.

## What it does
Travolator is an AI-powered platform that adds a touch of excitement to your journey by generating fun and unique locations to explore between your origin and destination. Whether you're taking a road trip, traveling by train, or flying to your destination, Travolator suggests hidden gems, local attractions, and off-the-beaten-path spots that you might have otherwise missed.

## How we built it
Travolator was built with a focus on maximizing performance and delivering a seamless user experience. To achieve this, we opted for a front-end website architecture, eliminating the need for a traditional backend system. This approach allowed us to leverage the full potential of client-side technologies and ensure lightning-fast response times.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the challenges we encountered during the development of Travolator was finding a way to obtain Google routes without relying on their API to minimize developer expenses. While Google Maps API offers robust routing capabilities, it comes with associated costs that can add up, especially when dealing with a large number of requests.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of our significant accomplishments during the development of Travolator was successfully finding a free library that facilitated location autocomplete. Location autocomplete is a crucial feature that enhances the user experience by suggesting and predicting destinations as users type in their search queries.

## What we learned
Through the development of Travolator, we learned that creating a seamless and feature-rich application without a backend or significant financial investment can be a highly challenging endeavor. While building a front-end website can provide a fast and responsive experience, certain limitations arise when it comes to complex functionalities and data management.

## What's next
Next on our roadmap for Travolator, we have exciting plans to enhance the site map and planning capabilities of the platform. Our aim is to provide users with a comprehensive and interactive tool that assists in visualizing their travel itineraries and optimizing their time and costs.
